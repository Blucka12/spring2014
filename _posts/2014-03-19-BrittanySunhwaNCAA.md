##Reflections

We ran into some difficulties during the course of this assignment. When we pushed our final files with the updated statistics, we came across a merge conflict. We think this was due to the fact that we didn't pull before we each made our changes to our respective files in step 2. Otherwise, Github seems to definitely be a useful tool for collaboration; it will just require more practice so that we can better get used to the workflow and the order of commands needed in order to efficiently work together. It is encouraging that despite the errors and problems, we were able to easily resolve them without losing our work.
