Note you have two extra days for this assignment.  Get started early- you will likely need the extra time.  Several of these problems are tricky!  Remember to use your resources: your classmates, our community, the Internet, and Grant and I.

## Codingbat Test-driven learning

Codingbat is like batting practice for coding.  There are small little problems with several tests listed over on the side.  As you write and run the program you'll see more and more of the tests turn green.  This mimics the programming technique of [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) where the behavior of a program is specified at the beginning by writing tests.

As you work through these problems, try some of the strategies in our reading on [Debugging](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Debugging/debugIntro.html).
