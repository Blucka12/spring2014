We misinterpreted the instructions and originally operated off of one branch entitled "ZachAllen".. Zach wrote the 
fields for Mercer, Allen wrote the fields for Dayton, and we pushed from our local branches to the master. Then we pulled from the master and filled
in the info (wins, appearances, and coach).

We had to start over with the two separate branches to comply with the assignment, Mercer and Dayton. 
The complexity of trying to undo what we had done caused some problems, including merge conflicts that had to be resolved in Nitrous.

I won't speak for Allen, but I will chalk our difficulties up to an inadequate grasp on the branching paradigm. Using a single
branch for our edits seemed like a perfectly reasonable idea. It is just now setting in that branching must be done liberally and updated only
from the master branch.
