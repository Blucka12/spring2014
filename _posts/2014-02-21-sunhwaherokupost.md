After SSH key was added to my Heroku account, I was able to go on to my heroku site:
http://silshack-sunhwa.herokuapp.com.  The site let me type my first post when I added /admin to this url. 
I made some attempts to make several changes to CSS layout codes to hope to get the site to look better 
but failed.  So I just added a couple of file extensions such as doc. Tiff., in the  ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = 
set(['txt', 'pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif','doc','tiff']) since not many were allowed.  
So Sunhwaâ€™s very simple plain looking post was created.
