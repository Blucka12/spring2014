title: Codingbat Exercise Was Helpful!

# Until this point, I was struggling to understand how I needed to talk to python, but I think that I'm starting to get the hang of it.

# 1

## I liked the "make_abba" exercise in "Strings" because it showed me that some of these solutions can be simple and it didn't take me terribly long to get how to solve it.

# 2

## The next one I particularly liked was the "make_tags" exercise in "Strings", because it gave me a glimpse of how python can interact with HTML.

# 3

## The one that I found to be the hardest was "alarm_clock" in the "Logic" section. It had a lot of variables that tripped me out at first, but breaking down the logical arguments one by one really walked it through. I still think problems like this one will be a challenge for me.
