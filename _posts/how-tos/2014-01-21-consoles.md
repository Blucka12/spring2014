title: Including consoles in your posts
categories: how-to

You can include runnable code in your post by adding a Python console:

{% include python %}

for i in ["I", "love", "Python"]:
  print i
  
{% include endpython %}

You'll need some include statements to do this.  Include statements pull in code that starts and finishes the code block:

```
{% raw %}{% include python %}

for i in ["I", "love", "Python"}:
  print i
  
{% include endpython %}{% endraw %}
```

A HUGE thanks to SILShacker and TA Grant McClendon for getting this working and looking pretty.
