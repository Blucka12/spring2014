title: Splat Space in Durham

I'm reporting live from "Splat Space" in Downtown Durham, located under downstairs next to the "Beyou Cafe" on Main St., and I feel as awesome as this picture is:

The event started with a couple members introducing and opening up the space, making announcements, introducing newcomers and making people aware of projects. There are a wide array of projects that then start up organically based on what people are interested in. 

I was prompted to introduce myself, and saw the look of recognition from the members in attendance who had previously met a couple others from our class. 

Once introductions were over, people broke out into groups as they choose, and some just float around to socialize. I huddled up with another guys who was interested in pygame, which I had only heard a little about at that point. 

I'm going to hang here for a little while, but wanted to get started with posting about it while in the moment, but Splat Space is a very warm and welcoming space to visit, and I intend to come back!
