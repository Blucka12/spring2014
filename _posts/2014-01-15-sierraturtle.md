If I surround something with backticks it's rendered in `code`

Here are my awesome reflections, links and bla bla description what I thought.

```
import turtle

 wn = turtle.Screen() 
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

tess = turtle.Turtle() 
tess.color("blue")
tess.pensize(3)
tess.forward(50)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(50)

wn.exitonclick()
```
