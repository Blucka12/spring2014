Yes, that's right: Professor Jekyll loves group projects.  Just include the author names in a Yaml list:

```
author:
  - jdoe
  - squw
```

As long as Jekyll can find those authors in your `_config.yml` you'll see a pretty list of the authors on the post.

Special thanks to [gerbal](http://github.com/gerbal) for this feature.
