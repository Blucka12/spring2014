## Tweets

Nice work on this!  I'm [working on the tweethack repo as a project](https://github.com/silshack/tweethack).  Time for a demo.

## Merge Conflicts

1. Make a repo
2. Both clone it
3. Both edit a file & commit the change
4. One person push
5. Other person pull
6. Resolve conflicts
7. Commit & push resolution

## Branching

Always branch from the main branch!  (`gh-pages` for our site; `master` for most repos)

## Proposals

The proposal assignment is up, Due Sunday.  We'll spend the balance of time in class workshopping a group's project and then working on the assignment.
