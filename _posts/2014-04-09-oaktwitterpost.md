title: Twitter from the Command Line!

I was thankful to be "Vannah" for this part of our class's learning. I submitted this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Testing tweeting from command line, fam...bear with me...</p>&mdash; Oak Ritchie (@oakritchie) <a href="https://twitter.com/oakritchie/statuses/448867427976491011">March 26, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then I added a cheeky: "It puts the lotion on its skin..."

A couple other users inquired as to how to do it, and I'm looking forward to teaching others how!
